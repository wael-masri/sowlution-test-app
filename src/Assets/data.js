      "It's hard to put together a meaningful UI prototype without making real requests to an API. By making real requests, you'll uncover problems with application flow, timing, and API design early, improving the quality of both the user experience and API. With Mockaroo, you can design your own mock APIs, You control the URLs, responses, and error conditions. Paralellize UI and API development and start delivering better applications faster today!",

    description: "If you're developing an application, you'll want to make sure you're testing it under conditions that closely simulate a production environment. In production, you'll have an army of users banging away at your app and filling your database with data, which puts stress on your code.

    date: "Dec 09,2022",
    description: "When your test database is filled with realistic looking data, you'll be more engaged as a tester. When you demonstrate new features to others, they'll understand them faster. Real data is varied and will contain characters that may not play nice with your code, such as apostrophes, or unicode characters from other languages. Testing with realistic data will make your app more robust because you'll catch errors that are likely to occur in production before release day.",
